# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

## Deployment

This project is configured with `@sveltejs/adapter-vercel` for seamless deployment to Vercel.
